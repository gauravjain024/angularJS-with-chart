![alt text](https://github.com/gauravjain024/angularJS-with-chart/blob/master/images/Capture.JPG?raw=true)

1. Use a public fake REST API : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
2. This page has been distributed in the following sections :
3. THE PIE CHART : The pie chart should be an actual representation of the
data fetched from the public API. It would contain different sections :

4. THE PERCENTAGE BOX : It should show the number of users out of 100
that your public hosted API will fetch. (basically it will give out 10 users so
calculate percentage accordingly )

5. THE DATA TABLE : Fill the data-table with the public api mentioned above
to fetch data and filter-out only required values and populate the data-table.

## Assumptions :
1. All the data should be fetched from the public API.
2. Do not put any random data inside any box.
3. The Page should be completely responsive (Mobile and desktop friendly).
4. Kindly host your single page application on Github.
5. Use Angular Material library for quick results.
